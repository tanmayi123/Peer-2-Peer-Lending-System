# Peer-2-Peer-Lending-System

Introduction


The traditional way of funding for a college student aspiring to venture into the world of start-ups with creative ideas and technology that can potentially bring a change to the society, include, going to banks to acquire bank loans or getting a funding via research and scholarship programs. However, this process is cumbersome, involves a lot of time and eligibility constraints. The aim of this project is to eliminate the middleman (bank) and create a platform for Northeastern Students by connecting students to alumni investors through a Peer-2-Peer lending system which would enable students to acquire loans for their entrepreneurial ventures with the help of strong alumni networks.


The aim is to create a platform that is decentralized and has a secure environment for loan transactions and is beneficial for both borrowers and lenders. This platform would provide flexible financing options for students, and alumni will also benefit from earning good returns as the middleman (bank) is obsolete in this picture.


Objective

The main objective of the P2P platform for northeastern students is to:


1.Help students (borrowers) to bring forward their start up ideas and get funding from alumni investors


2.Help Alumni (lenders) invest in and fund student start-ups, negotiate loan payment terms and gain back returns on their investments

Theory for P2P Lending Platform


The P2P lending platform provides a secure environment where borrowers can seek loans in exchange for startup ideas, and lenders can directly invest without intermediaries. Users create profiles as borrowers or lenders, containing personal details, startup categories, and business ideas. Borrowers can search for lenders, submit loan applications with terms such as amount, repayment plan, interest rate, collateral, and financial projections, while lenders can review profiles and connect directly to discuss investments.



The system supports multiple loans per borrower and lender, maintains loan histories, audit logs for transparency, dispute management to pause transactions when needed, real-time notifications for key events, and feedback and rating mechanisms. A built-in referral system encourages platform growth while enabling informed, direct, and transparent lending decisions.
